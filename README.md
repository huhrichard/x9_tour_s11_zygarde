# The Power of Z...zZzZ

TLDR: Have fun to play with Zygarde if you have spare time ZZZ.
珍惜生命，遠離Z神。

I am huh/Richard, admin B of Gengar Hater [FB](https://www.facebook.com/GengarHater/)/[IG](https://www.instagram.com/gengar.hater/), who is pretty new to VGC double battle. I was a single battle player before SwSh, so sometimes the team building is still closed to single battle mindset.

我係huh/Richard，Genger Hater的Admin B， VGC嚟講算是新手吧，劍盾以前都係玩單打，所以組隊思維而言都係比較接近單打的。

Actually I was expecting to play S10 format in the tournament which I get into Top8 with [Yveltal in Eakes' sub tournament](https://pokepast.es/3e0af8d0a39e45a6), which is also a kind of off-meta and defensive team. I changed the [Yveltal team a bit](https://pokepast.es/8a56106fe3ae54dd) to be more offensive with Quiver Dance Volarona. As Joe said, we are gonna play S11 but there is no practice platform on Showdown/ranked battle. Within this week, I can only play the team I used/the restricted in S8 I am familarized with. 

本來我以為係打S10，就諗住用之前top cut過嘅極受+非主流[Y雀隊](https://pokepast.es/3e0af8d0a39e45a6). 後尾改咗用[蝶舞火蛾進取少少]((https://pokepast.es/8a56106fe3ae54dd))。不過後尾Joe話會打S11，但係喺冇任何練習平台底下，呢一個星期內，我只能夠用返一啲S8用過嘅隊/S神。

In S8, I played with a few restricted pokemons, e.g. those T0 pkm, Zacian, Calyrex-Shadow. I did play CS/AV icy wind Kyurem-W, WP Dialga, Rayquaza, and also Zygarde. Zygarde was the most secure one I played before, although not a sunny team setup I used yesterday: https://pokepast.es/93fc718c05893f16

喺S8，我玩過嘅S神包括：T0嘅劍狗，鬼馬王，仲有圍巾/背心嘅冷凍之風白冰龍，弱點保險鑽石、綠毛蟲，同埋Z神。Z神係我勝率比較好嘅S神，雖然之前並唔係用尋日嘅晴隊配置: https://pokepast.es/93fc718c05893f16


The weaknesses of Zygarde are Ice/Dragon/Fairy. For restricted, there are Zacian, Calyrex-Ice, Ice Beam Kyogre and those Dragon-type legendaries. For non-restricted meta, Tapu Fini/Lele are the threats. Others are always 50/50 games, even against the Incineroar, as you see how I play in the tour. Also, its unique move, Thousand Arrows can knocked down Flying-type/Levitate and even Air Ballon Pokemon, so there is no concern about making no damage as a ground-type move. I didnt hard calculate the stamina of Zygarde for certain pokemons, but for this stats, it can take most of neutral attack (including Zacian B-blade but not play rough for sure). Then here Zygarde will come the 100% one (which really look like Gundam/from robots anime) if you survive. Substite and Protect are helpful for setting up the 100%, since you know protect get rid of the double locked damages, and substitute may get rid of the ohko by 25% HP instead.


劍狗弱點係冰/龍/妖。S神嚟講最常見就係劍狗，冰馬王，冰光嘅海皇牙，仲有嗰堆龍系神獸，其他主流竉就係Fini/Lele。除咗頭先講嗰啲竉，好多時都係50/50，講緊就算對住係火貓，我比賽都係R緊佢痕。最值得一提就係獨門技千箭齊發Thousand Arrows, 將飛行系/浮游嘅竉都拉落嚟，所以冇地面系會出現無效嘅情況。我冇認真計過Z神嘅耐久擋到啲乜，但係無屬性相剋下都應該食到，包括劍狗嘅巨獸斬(當然唔包括Play Rough)，食完攻擊就可以變做100%(高達mode)。替身/保護都係幫你變成100%嘅好招式，例如保護可以擋雙鎖，替身就用25%HP頂一下強攻。

The team I used in S8 before is half-fun team, using Celesteela and Rotom-H to play against the Zacian/Calyrex-Ice. The terrain from Tapu Rilla/Fini help to setup Zygarde (heal/preventing status). Persian-Alola is the last one I added to against Calyrex-Shadow as a dark type, and also high physical defense with its unique ability. The only thing is lacked of speed control, which can only rely on Fake out/Icy wind.

上面我S8用嗰隊算係半娛樂隊吧，輝夜+微波爐頂劍狗/冰馬王。草猩/Fini嘅草/妖場(回血/防狀態)都有助setup Zygarde。阿羅拉高竇貓係最後一隻加入，用嚟擋鬼馬，亦因為特性都有唔錯嘅物防。唯一問題就係欠缺speed control，只能靠
Fake out/Icy wind去打先手。


I knew it's not a highly competetive team, so I go to look up the Zygarde team on Victory Road. Hmm, there are only two teams, the sunny and Comfey team. Comfey is one of the pokemon I like to play, but with non-restricted format, like S7/9 or before. Under the threat of Zacian/Solgaleo/Necrozma Dusk Mane, Comfey is not easy to play, especially Zygarde can only make a 50/50 games (maybe 60/40?) against those steel restricted as a ground-type. So I am going to with the Sunny team, with the powerful Venusaur G-max Vine Lash. Luckily I get a chance to test [my Z-sunny team](https://pokepast.es/0f076215553db483) with Tapu Fini & Moltres in Joe's S11 Ladder Tour. Turn out the result is 6-1 and rank #4. The only lost is against Joe's Y-Coalossal team by time-over, although both of us don't intend to stall the timer. Also, I practiced with [Admin D, Sam](https://twitter.com/samnggg_tsng) with his Necrozma Dusk Mane. I also tried to play this team on S10 ranked battle. Tapu Fini without calm mind sometimes have nth to do, also is not super effective against Kyogre's team. And rn I understand why Gahaku used Grimmsnarl instead. Charizard is a offensive choice against the mirror sunny match-up, but weak to the classic Thundurus+Urshifu lead. [Rotom-Heat is the answer](https://pokepast.es/0931ce28fe6e2ad7)!

咁當然我理解呢隊出去比賽一啲都唔好打，所以就去咗Victory Road度碌下有咩Z神隊可以參考下。但遺憾地就只有兩隊，晴隊同埋花圈隊。花圈係我都幾鐘意用嘅竉，但係講緊係冇S神嘅規，例如S7/9或者更加早之前嘅規。尤其喺劍狗/日獅/日蝕面前下，花圈真係一下就88，講緊Z神作為一隻地面系，只能夠同佢地呢啲鋼系55開(或者64開?)。所以我就著眼喺晴隊嗰邊入手，用主流嘅Gmax奇異花。亦都好好彩見到Joe開咗個S11 online比賽，比我去試[Z神+晴隊](https://pokepast.es/0f076215553db483)，嗰陣係用緊Fini+關東火鳥，最後都拎到6勝1敗，排第四。唯一一敗就係TO打輸比Joe嘅Y雀+炭山隊，即使講緊我同佢都冇刻意stall timer。之後我都搵咗[Admin D, Sam](https://twitter.com/samnggg_tsng)嘅日蝕隊幫我試隊。再加上我直接拎咗隊嘢喺S10 rank度試，發現冇冥想Fini好易卡場，同埋都唔係咁有效反打海皇牙隊。咁我就明點解Gahaku會用長毛。而噴火龍的確係好強嘅進攻手，但係對住雷雲+師父熊嘅組合係極唔好打，而我之前用過嘅[微波爐就係答案了](https://pokepast.es/0931ce28fe6e2ad7)!

@ Leftovers 剩飯

Ability: Power Construct 群眾變形

EVs: 4 HP / 180 Atk / 68 Def / 252 SpD / 4 Spe  

Impish Nature (+Def -SpA)
- Thousand Arrows 千箭齊發
- Coil  盤蜷
- Protect 保護
- Substitute 替身

Since either the HP base stats of Zygarde-50% or 100% are quite high, it's not worth to invest HP EV to maximum the stamina. 

*SKIP THIS if you don't like math:* It's because mainly becoz of the % changes, The HP stat with for Zygarde-50% with 0 HP ev = 183, and if you all in 252HP evs on Zygarde, it is gonna to be 215 (17.3% increase). But for Zygarde-100%, the HP stat with 0 hp ev = 291, 252HP evs is gonna to be 323 (only 11% increase). Also, you can see the Def and SpD with 0 evs, it is gonna to be 141 and 115, which is less than 291/2 (145.5). This implies 12HP evs (2HP stats) can gain 0.68% increase of stamina, but 4evs on both Def & SpD (total 8 evs) can gain 0.71% and 0.87% to its perspective stamina. This applies to some other pokemon too, like bulky Regieleki. The second reason is when activate the power construct, the HP recovered is fixed to be 108 HP, so you may treat the lower HP you have, the higher % of HP recover you will have. Of coz, it depends on how confident you are in the Power Construct mechanism, since it's not instant change/recover, unlike the sitrus berry

Zygarde is not always dynamax choice, so just max the sp. def. for coil. I was using struggling to pick 2 out of Iron Tail/Protect/Sub, which I finally just decide to go with Protect/Sub to make the Power Contruct came easier, also the sub can prevent intimidate from Incineroar(but not parting shot...)/Landorus-T.

由於不論係Z神50%定100%嘅HP種族值都好高嘅關係，投放HP努力值落Z神係唔化算。

*討厭數學可以跳過:* 主要就是比率變化嘅問題，0HP努力值嘅Z神-50% HP = 183, all in 252HP就會係215 (17.3%增長)。但係Z-100%嚟講，0HP努力值就已經有291HP, 252HP就係323HP (只有11%耐久增加)。而我地再睇下物防同特防, 141, 115,仲少過HP 291嘅一半(145.5)。咁意味你投放12HP努力值(2HP能力值)就只會加0.68%耐力，而物防特防各4努力值(共8)分別加到物耐0.71%同埋0.87%特耐。呢樣其實都應用到喺其他竉度，例如坦型嘅電柱。第二原因就係特性群眾變形，發動時固定回復108HP,咁當你HP愈低嘅時候，固定嘅回復量，比率就會愈高。咁當然亦都會考你嘅控血技巧，因為特性並唔似文柚果咁樣會即時發動。

Z神並唔係成日用嚟極巨，咁所以冇極地升特防下，我係揀咗直接252特防，而物防就可以靠Coil。招式上要喺鐵尾/保護/替身選2，最後係揀咗保護+替身令到我更加易發動特性，而替身可以防止啲威嚇手彈出彈入。

IVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe  
- Yawn  呵欠

The sp. def. Torkoal used in PJCS Champion クララ team got from serial code.
直接拎咗配布嗰嘅龜嚟用LOL

@ Coba Berry  

Ability: Chlorophyll  

EVs: 140 HP / 4 Def / 236 SpA / 4 SpD / 124 Spe  

Modest Nature  

IVs: 0 Atk  
- Frenzy Plant  
- Sludge Bomb  
- Sleep Powder  
- Earth Power 

Classic Gmax Venusaur, I was struggling on choosing AV/Life Orb/Coba Berry, AV will make a easier game with Kyogre, while Life Orb need to play hyper offensive, Coba Berry kind of a middle choice with better match-up to those Max Airstream. Unfournately the only two sleep powder were both missed.
好大路嘅Gmax奇異花，喺AV/命玉/抗飛果掙扎咗好耐。AV打海皇牙會輕鬆啲，命玉就係進取啲，抗飛果就對抗極飛手。不幸地冇做開眠粉仔，兩下都miss曬。

@ Eviolite 進化輝石

Ability: Trace 同步  

EVs: 252 HP / 188 Def / 4 SpA / 60 SpD / 4 Spe  

Calm Nature  (+Spd -Attack)

IVs: 0 Atk  
- Trick Room 欺騙空間
- Eerie Impulse 怪異電波 
- Foul Play 欺詐
- Recover 自我回復

Also a classic eerie impulse + foul play P2 under restricted format, EVs average spread for both phy. and sp. def. 4SpA evs is left becoz I used it for non-restricted format LOL. Personally is not playing hard TR here, so the speed of P2 is not minimized.


亦都係一隻經典嘅怪異電波+欺詐嘅立2，物防特防均分，剩4特攻努力值係以前用嗰陣留落。個人而言唔係主打欺空，所以立2都冇min speed.


![Grimmsnarl](/images/861.png)

@ Light Clay 光之黏土

Ability: Prankster 惡作劇之心

EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 132 Def / 116 SpD / 4 Spe  

Careful Nature  
- Reflect  反射壁
- Light Screen  光牆
- Spirit Break  靈魂衝擊
- Thunder Wave  電磁波

Friends of mine know I am always running out of resources, like dmax candy etc, but I purposely use a vmax Grimmsnarl in case. I just felt the Misty Terrain may help a bit for Zygarde. I chose TW instead of Scary Face becoz I felt Zygarde/Venusaur can handle most of the Ground/Electric pkm. The semifinal match-up with offensive Dragapult prove its usage, although I found Z-100% should put a bit more speed EVs to outspeed the paralyzed Dragapult/Zacian/Calyrex-Shadow.

識我嘅都知我成日缺資源，例如極巨果實etc,不過我係特登用vmax的，真係唔好彩嘅話妖場都可以cover到Z神。我揀用電磁波係因為Z神/奇異花足夠應付電系/地系。咁turn out喺4強面對攻型多龍都反映到佢用處，不過我其實要再放多少少速度努力值先可以令Z神100%都快過麻庳咗多龍/劍狗/鬼馬王。

@ Safety Goggles  防塵眼鏡

Ability: Levitate 浮游  

EVs: 252 HP / 100 Def / 116 SpA / 4 SpD / 36 Spe  

Modest Nature  

IVs: 0 Atk  
- Thunderbolt  十萬伏特
- Nasty Plot  陰謀
- Protect  保護
- Overheat 過熱

Rotom-Heat is great counter to Zacian, Calyrex-Ice, the mirror sunny match-up, although the stamina is not super high. So I still bring protect instead of ally switch, although AS would be a good cover to Zygarde. Also Grimmsnarl's screens helps a lot on the damage reduce to Rotom-H.

微波爐打劍狗，冰馬王，晴隊mirror對決都係一流，即使耐力真係有限，所以我都係帶咗保護，冇做到換位仔，雖然換位cover Z神真係一流。同埋喺長毛雙牆下，耐力都非常之好


This team itself is quite flexable, 3 dynamax choices: Zygarde/Venusaur/Rotom-H and 3 supports.
I didn't came up with much strategies about the lead, but feel free to ask. I am pretty luck didnt see any Kyogre in the tournament, and hax with the last 2 battle in the final, but at least I get into the final without much hax before.

呢隊嚟講彈性係好高，3隻極巨手：Z神/奇異花/微波爐，再加3隻support手。首發方面我冇乜特別對策，不過歡迎發問。不得不承認我係好好彩，冇遇到任何海皇牙隊，同埋決賽最後兩場真係嚴重hax，不過晉身決賽前都冇乜hax過。
