The Power of Z...zZzZ

TLDR: Have fun to play with Zygarde if you have spare time ZZZ

I am huh, which is pretty to VGC double battle. I was a single battle player before SwSh, so sometimes my team was formed under single battle mindset.

Actually I was expecting to play S10 format in the tournament which I get into Top8 with [Yveltal in Eakes' sub tournament](https://pokepast.es/3e0af8d0a39e45a6). So I changed the [Yveltal team a bit]( https://pokepast.es/8a56106fe3ae54dd) which is also a kind of off-meta and defensive team. As Joe said, we are gonna play S11 and there is no practice platform on Showdown/ranked battle. Within this week, I can only play the team I used/the restricted in S8 I am familarized with. 

In S8, I played a few restricted team, e.g. those T0 pkm, Zacian, Calyrex-Shadow. I did play CS/AV icy wind Kyurem-W, WP Dialga, Rayquaza, and also Zygarde. Zygarde was the most secure one I played before, although not a sunny team setup I used yesterday: https://pokepast.es/93fc718c05893f16

The weaknesses of Zygarde are Ice/Dragon/Fairy. For restricted, there are Zacian, Calyrex-Ice, Ice Beam Kyogre and those Dragon-type legendaries. For non-restricted meta, Tapu Fini/Lele are the threats. Others are always 50/50 games, even against the Incineroar. The team I used before is half-fun team, using Celesteela and Rotom-H to play against the Zacian/Calyrex-Ice. The terrain from Tapu Rilla/Fini help to setup Zygarde (heal/preventing status). Persian-Alola is the last one I added to against Calyrex-Shadow as a dark type, and also high physical defense with its unique ability. The only thing is lacked of speed control, which can only rely on Fake out/Icy wind.

I knew it's not a highly competetive team, so I go to look up the Zygarde team on Victory Road. Hmm, there are only two teams, the sunny and Comfey team. Comfey is one of the pokemon I like to play with non-restricted format, like S7/9 or before. Under the threat of Zacian/Solgaleo/Necrozma Dusk Mane, Comfey is not easy to play, especially Zygarde can only make a 50/50 games (maybe 60/40?) against those steel restricted. So I am going to with the Sunny team, with the powerful Venusaur G-max Vine Lash. Luckily I get a chance to test [my Z-sunny team](https://pokepast.es/0f076215553db483) with Tapu Fini & Moltres in Joe's S11 Ladder Tour. Turn out the result is 6-1 and rank #4. The only lost is against Joe's Y-Coalossal team by time-over, although both of us don't intend to stall the clock. Also, I practiced with [Sam](https://twitter.com/samnggg_tsng) with his Necrozma Dusk Mane. I also tried to play this team on S10 ranked battle. Tapu Fini without calm mind sometimes have nth to do, also is not super effective against Kyogre's team. And rn I understand why Gahaku used Grimmsnarl instead. Charizard is a offensive choice against the mirror sunny match-up, but weak to the classic Thundurus+Urshifu lead. [Rotom-Heat is the answer](https://pokepast.es/0931ce28fe6e2ad7)!

@ Leftovers 
Ability: Power Construct  
EVs: 4 HP / 180 Atk / 68 Def / 252 SpD / 4 Spe  
Impish Nature  
- Thousand Arrows  
- Coil  
- Protect  
- Substitute
Since either the HP stats of Zygarde-50% or 100% are quite high, it's not worth to invest HP EV to maximum the stamina. Zygarde is not always dynamax choice, so just max the sp. def. for coil. I was using struggling to pick 2 out of Iron Tail/Protect/Sub, which I finally just decide to go with Protect/Sub to make the Power Contruct came easier.

- Frenzy Plant  
- Sludge Bomb  
- Sleep Powder  
- Earth Power 
Classic Gmax Venusaur, I was struggling with AV/Life Orb/Coba Berry, AV will make a easier game with Kyogre, while Life Orb need to play hyper offensive, Coba Berry kind of a middle choice with better match-up to those Max Airstream.

Calm Nature  
IVs: 0 Atk  
- Trick Room

Also a classic eerie impulse + foul play P2 under restricted format, EVs spread for both phy. and sp. def. 4SpA is left becoz I used it for non-restricted format LOL.

@ Light Clay  
Ability: Prankster  
Level: 50  
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 132 Def / 116 SpD / 4 Spe  
Careful Nature  
- Reflect  
- Light Screen  
- Spirit Break  
- Thunder Wave
Friends of mine know I am always running out of resources, like dmax candy etc, but I purposely use a vmax Grimmsnarl in case. I just felt the Misty Terrain may help a bit for Zygarde. I choose TW instead of Scary Face becoz of I felt Zygarde/Venusaur can handle most of the Ground/Electric pkm. The semifinal match-up with offensive Dragapult prove its usage, although I found Z-100% should put a bit more speed EVs to outspeed Dragapult/Zacian/Calyrex-Shadow.

@ Safety Goggles  
Ability: Levitate  
Level: 60  
EVs: 252 HP / 100 Def / 116 SpA / 4 SpD / 36 Spe  
Modest Nature  
IVs: 0 Atk  
- Thunderbolt  
- Nasty Plot  
- Protect  
- Overheat
Rotom-Heat is great counter to Zacian, Calyrex-Ice, the mirror sunny match-up, although the stamina is super high, so I still bring protect instead of ally switch, although AS would be a good cover to Zygarde. Also Grimmsnarl's screens helps a lot on the damage reduce to Rotom-H.

This team itself is quite flexable, 3 dynamax choices: Zygarde/Venusaur/Rotom-H and 3 supports.
I didn't came up with much strategies about the lead, but feel free to ask.
